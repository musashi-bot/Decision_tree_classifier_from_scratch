# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier from Scratch

This project is a pure NumPy and Pandas implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier, built from scratch to demonstrate a deep understanding of how decision trees work. The only use of scikit-learn is for **measuring accuracy**.

I use the classic **Iris dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
